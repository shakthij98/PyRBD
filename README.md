# PyRBD
An open-source Python tool for RBD evaluation
PyRBD is suitable for complex systems and networks with bidirectional links between components and cyclic loops.
PyRBD leverages the conditional decomposition method (CDM) along with the minimal cut set (MCS) approach for its fast processing.
The performance analysis of PyRBD has been submitted to the IEEE CQR 2024 workshop.

This work has been funded by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development, and Energy under the project `6G Future Lab Bavaria'.


In the example topology, Abilene, the NetworkX graph object is saved in Pickle format. The users are welcome to save their graphs in any other format.
PyRBD works for any topology and any node availability. 
Visualizing the results is left to the user's preference.
